Please answer the following two questions:

1. What is a join (just in your own words) and why is it useful?
--A join is a way to combine data from row(s) and column(s) on a table.
--A join allows you to analyze relationships in the tables and understand how the data is connected.


2. Consider the structure of the posts table: why would you want to use a foreign key (user_id) to the users table instead of storing the username, first_name, and last_name in the posts table?
--A foreign key serves as a unique identifier that simplifies finding data within a database, providing an efficient way to select and access information.
